Our love for exotic plants began many years ago, as we traveled the world in search of new and exciting species to add to our own personal collections. We were constantly amazed by the incredible diversity of plants that exist, each with its own unique shape, color, and texture. We wanted to share this wonder with others, and so we founded this business with the goal of bringing the magic of exotic plants to people all over the world.
